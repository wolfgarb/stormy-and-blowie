# What's the weather?

## stormy-and-blowie

## Purpose
An easy and sleek weather app that delivers you weather information by location! Search for a city to find the current stats and 4-day forecast.

In honor of the local Kansas City weather man Gary Lezak, my repo is in honor of his two dogs Stormy and Breezy. An inside joke between some friends of the time I misremembered the name of his second dog as "Blowie" instead of Breezy. Apologies Gary!
